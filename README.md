# HerokuHeadless

## What?
Push from your git repo to a heroku app without any external configuration.

## Why?
Heroku's workflow is geared towards pushing to a heroku app from a dev workstation. This gem makes it easy to push to a heroku app as part of a CI/CD setup.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'heroku-headless'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install heroku-headless
